# network-monitoring-AI-bot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI tool to help monitor &amp; troubleshoot various network domains and topologies.

## Background

The problem is that network engineers get same question on weekly basis that what could be the problem that connection is not working. The situation might be different in network operation centers where they have state-of-art network monitoring tools & solution. But in many smaller companies or teams the only way to troubleshoot the issue is to check current network element configurations and status.
The actual information is availabe but can't be accessed by normal users. Due that network elements account policies (restricted access for limited engineers).

If all this time that is spent by network engineer to get data from network, that could be utilized by machine learning AI - tool (or chatbot), it would eventually leave time for more important issues like network planning, optimatization and overall network performance increase. On top of that the problems are almost are identical so it will make the network engineer daily work tasks more interresting which is my personal motivation to use AI solution.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
