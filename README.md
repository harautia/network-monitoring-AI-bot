# network-monitoring-AI-bot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI tool to help monitor &amp; troubleshoot various network domains and topologies.

## Background

The problem is that network engineers get same question on weekly basis that what could be the problem when connection is not working. The situation might be different in network operation centers where they have state-of-the-art network monitoring tools & solution. But in many smaller companies or teams the only way to troubleshoot the issue is to check current network element configurations and routing status from the routers or switches by network engineer. So the information that is needed to solve the issue is availabe but can't be accessed by normal users. Due that network elements account policies (restricted access for network engineers).

If all this time that is spent by network engineer to get data from network, that could be utilized by machine learning AI - tool (or chatbot), it would eventually leave time for more important issues like network planning, optimatization and better network performance. On top of that the problems are almost are identical so it will make the network engineer daily work tasks more interresting which is my personal motivation to use AI solution.

## How is it used?

It would require that different data sources are collected to single location which the AI tool will operate. Datastores are: network element configuration, status information and IP address management.

It would be machine learning based solution because the source data is 100% accurate, since it represent the actual state of the network. The use of AI is to identify possible solutions to solve the network issue. The AI tool should provide the corrective solution eg. replace fiber cable if that is broken, configuration change if the issue is there and if it can't solve the issue it should instruct the user to provide more detailed information.

Later phahes the tool could be able to predict for example soon to be breaking connections, if it has learned pattern from logs or statistics when connection has broken. Other import future task would be providing input to the network planning and solutions how to improve network resilience and performance.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
